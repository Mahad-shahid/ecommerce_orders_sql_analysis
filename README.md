 🛒 E-commerce Orders Analysis (SQL + Jupyter)

This project demonstrates the use of SQL with Python (sqlite3) for analyzing e-commerce order data inside a Jupyter Notebook. It's designed as a portfolio project to showcase realistic data modeling, querying, and business insights.


 📁 Dataset Overview

The project simulates an e-commerce environment using 4 main tables:

- Customers – Contains customer info (ID, name, city, email)
- Products – Contains product info (ID, name, category, price)
- Orders – Order-level data with dates and customer links
- OrderDetails – Line-item data connecting orders and products with quantities


 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python  
- SQLite (sqlite3 module)  
- jupyter Notebook
- Pandas


 🔍 Key SQL Concepts Used

- JOINS (INNER JOIN between multiple tables)
- Aggregate functions (SUM, COUNT, AVG)
- Grouping and filtering
- Sorting and aliasing
- View creation (optional, removed in final version for simplicity)


 📊 Sample Insights

- Total number of orders and revenue
- Top customers by spending
- Best-selling product categories
- Most active cities
- Orders with high quantities
- Products never ordered


 🧠 Purpose

This project is meant to showcase **practical SQL querying** and **data insight generation** inside a familiar Jupyter environment. It works well as a beginner-to-intermediate level demonstration for data analyst portfolios.
